  This my working Fullstack Developer Portfolio Website.  The website was built using React. It includes About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume sections.  To stylize and mobilize the site, I used Bootstrap, which easily makes components mobile responsive.

  ## Installation

  This website is not meant to be installed.

  In the resume section of this application, there is a button to download my resume.  Click the download button and it will download to your downloaded file on your computer.

  ## Usage

  This is to be used as my Fullstack Developer Portfolio.  As I continue to make applications, I can add them to the portfolio section and a new card will be rendered.

  ## Credits
  
  I relied on class material (Mini Project for Module 20) and worked with a tutor on some of the structure of this project.
